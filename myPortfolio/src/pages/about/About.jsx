              Hey there! I'm Nobz, a fashion lover turned software developer,
              with a passion for both stitching fabrics and stitching code. My
              journey into the tech world started when I watched a friend
              transform lines of code into a living, breathing application—it
              felt like magic! I couldn’t resist, so I asked if I could learn
              too, and before I knew it, I was knee-deep in Angela Yu's Udemy
              course, fully hooked.
            </p>
            <p className="about-paragraph">
              Coding hasn’t been all smooth sailing—I’ve had to juggle school,
              work, and learning—but here I am, building this portfolio, which
              feels like a massive step in the right direction. While I'm not
              quite where I want to be yet, the progress I've made has been
              exhilarating.
            </p>

            <p className="about-paragraph">
              For me, writing code in VS Code is like sewing a new garment.
              There's something magical about seeing a project take shape, piece
              by piece. Just like tailoring fabric into a perfectly fitted
              outfit, watching code come alive in the browser feels like seeing
              someone wear a custom-made piece of clothing. And when it all fits
              together flawlessly? That feeling is pure joy—it’s why I love what
              I do.
            </p>

            <p className="about-paragraph">
              As a developer, I’m focused on turning creative ideas into real,
              functional solutions. Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in
              JavaScript and React. I thrive on solving complex problems and,
              just like sewing, it’s about precision, patience, and getting all
              the details right.
            </p>

            <p className="about-paragraph">
              I’m always on the hunt for new technologies and ways to improve.
              My approach to coding, like fashion design, involves a balance of
              creativity and technical know-how, ensuring that every project is
              both beautiful and efficient. From front-end design to
              behind-the-scenes functionality, I take pride in every piece I
              create.
            </p>

            <p className="about-paragraph">
              The tech world feels like an endless runway of possibilities, and
              I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and collaborating. Whether
              it's fashion, coding, or something in between, I bring my
              excitement, dedication, and yes, a big smile to everything I do. I
              can't wait to see where this journey takes me next!
